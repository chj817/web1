    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing
    the presentation of a document written in a markup language.[1] Although
    most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces
    written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document,
    including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech,
    or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone
    technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user
    interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile
    applications.
